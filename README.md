# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript projects that demonstrate various concepts and techniques in web development. Each project is standalone and can be run independently in a web browser. The projects are designed to help improve your JavaScript skills and gain practical experience with real-world scenarios.

<!-- ##  Project List
1. Weather App
The Weather App is a web application that allows users to search for weather information for a specific location. It utilizes a weather API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly format. Users can enter a city name or zip code to get the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and other weather-related information.

2. ToDo List
The ToDo List project is a simple task management application that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. Users can add tasks with due dates, mark tasks as completed, and filter tasks based on their status. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

3. Calculator
The Calculator project is a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It has a simple user interface with buttons for numbers and operators, and it displays the result of the calculations in real-time. This project is a good exercise to practice JavaScript arithmetic operations and event handling.

4. Random Quote Generator
The Random Quote Generator is a web application that displays random quotes to users. It fetches quotes from an API and updates the UI with a new quote and its author whenever the user clicks a "Generate Quote" button. This project demonstrates how to work with APIs, fetch data using JavaScript, and dynamically update the UI.

5. Image Slider
The Image Slider project is a carousel-style image gallery that displays a series of images in a slideshow format. It allows users to navigate through the images using previous and next buttons or by clicking on dots at the bottom of the slider. This project is a great opportunity to practice working with images, animations, and event handling in JavaScript. -->
